# Text-Summairzation-Using-NLP-and-Cosine-Similarity
This repository contains Python code for generating automatic summaries of text documents using the TextRank algorithm, a graph-based algorithm for keyword extraction and summarization. TextRank is widely used for extractive text summarization, where important sentences are identified and extracted to form a concise summary of the input text.
